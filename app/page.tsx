        Vertical Expansion Planning | SUI 
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        
          Justworks' mission is to help entrepreneurs and businesses grow with confidence. Until today, our PEO product has primarily enabled us to serve white-collar desk workers. But Justworks' long-term success is predicated on fulfilling our mission for _all small businesses_ regardless of their industry.
          
          This memo details our focus and the investments required for the next 12-18 months to enable a best-in-class State Unemployment Program that disrupts the industry and advances Justworks into a future where we support a diverse range of businesses leveraging a key strategic program: Vertical Expansion.
          
          These investments are key as they set the stage for our growth over the next year and a half, allowing us to uphold our mission and vision across all product lines.
          
          Our projections indicate that with these enhancements, Justworks can not only support **additional small businesses** within our State unemployment Insurance (SUI) program but also experience incremental, rather than linear, growth in SUI revenue. In FY25, we expect these changes to contribute **$44.2 million in** **revenue** to Justworks.
          
          To elevate our SUI program into a comprehensive industry-leading platform and make it a major driver of growth, we are focused on the following areas -
          
          1. **Strategic Underwriting:** Boosting our SUI underwriting capabilities with technology to serve a diverse portfolio of businesses.  
          
          2. **Optimize PEO SUI Opportunity:** Leveraging our PEO entities to create competitive SUI rates over time and improve our profit margins.
          3. **Expand Client SUI:** Scaling up our SUI program to include all services for all customers in every state, not just PEO reporting states.  
          
          4. **Seamless SUI experience:** Developing comprehensive systems and streamlined processes that support our multi-product strategy, transforming the experience for both our customers and our internal teams.  
          
          5. **Launch SUI as a Standalone platform**: Setting up the SUI service as its own platform, starting with the basics of rate management, registration and claims management, so we can increase economies of scale through technology.  
          
          6. **Strategic Account Maintenance:** Enhancing our efforts with focused account maintenance to ensure we meet compliance standards and maintain the integrity of our SUI program.
