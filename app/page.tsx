        Vertical Expansion Planning | SUI 
      </h1>
    
        
      <p>
				Justworks' mission is to help entrepreneurs and businesses grow with confidence. Until today, our PEO product has primarily enabled us to serve white-collar desk workers. But Justworks' long-term success is predicated on fulfilling our mission for <em>all small businesses</em> regardless of their industry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This memo details our focus and the investments required for the next 12-18 months to enable a best-in-class State Unemployment Program that disrupts the industry and advances Justworks into a future where we support a diverse range of businesses leveraging a key strategic program: Vertical Expansion.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These investments are key as they set the stage for our growth over the next year and a half, allowing us to uphold our mission and vision across all product lines.&#xa0; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><em>&#xa0;</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Our projections indicate that with these enhancements, Justworks can not only support <strong>additional small businesses </strong>within our State unemployment Insurance (SUI) program but also experience incremental, rather than linear, growth in SUI revenue. In FY25, we expect these changes to contribute <strong>$44.2 million in</strong> <strong>revenue</strong> to Justworks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<p>
				To elevate our SUI program into a comprehensive industry-leading platform and make it a major driver of growth, we are focused on the following areas &mdash; 
			</p><br/>
		
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Strategic Underwriting:</strong> Boosting our SUI underwriting capabilities with technology to serve a diverse portfolio of businesses.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Optimize PEO SUI Opportunity:</strong> Leveraging our PEO entities to create competitive SUI rates over time and improve our profit margins.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Expand Client SUI: </strong>Scaling up our SUI program to include all services for all customers in every state, not just PEO reporting states.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Seamless SUI experience: </strong>Developing comprehensive systems and streamlined processes that support our multi-product strategy, transforming the experience for both our customers and our internal teams.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Launch SUI as a Standalone platform</strong>: Setting up the SUI service as its own platform, starting with the basics of rate management, registration and claims management, so we can increase economies of scale through technology.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Strategic Account Maintenance: </strong>Enhancing our efforts with focused account maintenance to ensure we meet compliance standards and maintain the integrity of our SUI program.<br /><br />
          </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>SUI Context</h2>
    <p>As we look to elevate our SUI program into a robust platform for growth, it's essential to understand the foundations of State Unemployment Insurance and its impact on our strategic direction.</p>

    <h3>State Unemployment Insurance (SUI)</h3>
    <p>State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) is a state-by-state program that employers pay into, as required by both Federal and State law. It's there to help workers with financial support if they lose their jobs and are looking for new employment. This insurance is mandatory in every state where a company has employees, meaning businesses need to get a state specific SUI account number and make payments into the system.</p>

    <p>The reason employers need SUI is to ensure their employees have some income support if their jobs are terminated. While the federal government sets the overall rules for this insurance, each state decides the specific benefits an unemployed worker can get. The program is funded by taxes from both the employer's and employee's income, known as FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) at the federal level and SUI (or sometimes SUTA - State Unemployment Tax Act) at the state level. As a small business adds employees in multiple states, keeping up with these requirements becomes increasingly complex and important.</p>

    <h3>Wage Base</h3>
    <p>In the context of SUI tax, a "wage base" is the maximum amount of an employee's earnings that can be taxed in a given year. Each state sets its own wage base for calculating SUI taxes. This means that once an employee's earnings exceed the state's specified wage base amount during a year, any additional income is not subject to SUI tax. For example, if a state's wage base is $10,000, and an employee earns $95,000 in a year, SUI taxes would only be calculated on the first $10,000. While the wage base typically resets on January 1st for most states, it is essential to note that an employee's wage base is reset when they change employers, even if it occurs mid-year.</p>

    <p>On the Justworks platform, a large proportion of employees reach their wage base by the end of February. As a result, approximately 85% of our SUI revenue is generated within the first two months of the year.</p>

    <h3>Reporting Types</h3>
    <p>Another nuance is a state's reporting type. Because of the co-employment relationship with our customers, there are primarily two different "reporting types" that govern how we manage SUI for customers. The key difference lies in the state's recognition of the employer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PEO Reporting:</strong> In states that recognize the PEO model, the PEO is considered the employer of record and is assigned an unemployment rate by the state. This arrangement allows PEOs to potentially charge their clients a rate that includes a margin, providing an opportunity for revenue through rate spreads. Currently, our average rate spread is 1.7%, and in FY24 this generated $37.7m of revenue. Today 81% of the WSEs (Worksite Employees) in the PEO are in PEO reporting states.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Reporting:</strong> In contrast, in states that do not recognize the PEO model, each business is responsible for its own unemployment insurance, reporting directly to the state and managing its own SUI rate and compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SUI at Justworks</h3>
    <p>We have traditionally used 3rd parties for important SUI functions such as annual PEO SUI rate setting and claims, and since we did not have the apparatus to manage risk effectively (multiple PEOs), we did not have an underwriting function in SUI. These limitations did not enable us to achieve our strategic and financial goals, created competitive disadvantages, and stifled our longer term potential. In FY24, we started shifting away from relying on external partners, and established the basics for SUI underwriting. As we enter FY25, we are building our own technology and operational capabilities to manage unemployment insurance more effectively, thus transforming our approach to State Unemployment Insurance. This includes improvements in underwriting, claims handling, and rate management. This shift is critical for improving management, compliance, and unlocking financial opportunities.</p>

    <p>With these adjustments, we anticipate a revenue increase to $44.2 million in FY25, up 15% from FY24. This is forecasted despite limited growth in our member base, highlighting the effectiveness of our new approach â€“ particularly in optimizing rate management. However, the forecasted $44.2 million revenue from rate adjustments only accounts for one PEO. To truly expand our business, we must cater to a more diverse set of businesses.</p>

    <h3>Example: Water St Bar & Grill vs. Eigen Software</h3>
    <p>Take, for example, two distinct prospects: Water St Bar & Grill and Eigen Software.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water St Bar & Grill, a restaurant, experiences high staff turnover but still needs additional temporary staff during the busy summer season.</li>
        <li>Eigen Software, a tech firm, enjoys high employee retention and is on the brink of expanding into a new state, with plans to hire more full-time staff.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These differences highlight that not only are these businesses distinct, but their needs are also varied. While we can currently support Eigen Software and aid their growth with our existing PEO structure, we are unable to accommodate Water St Bar & Grill's needs and risk profile, leading us to decline their business.</p>
    <p>Addressing such diverse requirements is critical for our expansion. We must explore how SUI, leveraged through our Multi-PEO strategy, can adapt to varied business profiles, enabling us to not just attract but effectively support a broader client base.</p>

    <h3>SUI and Multi-PEO</h3>
    <p>Justworks has historically seen impressive growth, exceeding 30% year-over-year, primarily by catering to white-collar industries. However, recent economic downturns, exemplified by the "white-collar recession" and high-profile events like the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, have exposed vulnerabilities associated with focusing too narrowly on specific sectors. These developments have reinforced the necessity of diversifying our customer base to maintain robust growth trajectories.</p>

    <p>To effectively support a diverse range of small businesses, Justworks needs a risk strategy that is similarly diverse, enabling a profitable approach to a wide variety of businesses. State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) is a critical tool in this strategy, due to significant cross industry differences in how employment fluctuates.</p>

    <p>Non-white-collar industries, such as hospitality, present distinct challenges that necessitate careful management under our PEO framework. For instance, hotels and restaurants often experience high turnover and seasonal employment fluctuations, leading to higher SUI rates due to frequent layoffs. Economic downturns can further impact these businesses by reducing travel and dining activities abruptly, increasing their SUI liabilities. Bucketing these types of businesses in the same PEO as low turnover businesses exposes the entire PEO to rising SUI rates and risks Justworks revenue.</p>

    <p>By leveraging SUI as a strategic tool within our multi-PEO model, we can assign businesses to the most appropriate PEO. This segmentation allows us to manage risk more effectively and offer more specialized services tailored to the specific challenges of each sector. For businesses in higher-risk industries, being placed in a distinct PEO can mean more targeted support and potentially more favorable SUI rates, mitigating the impact of their inherent risk factors.</p>

    <p>Thus, SUI not only serves as a differentiator for Justworks but also as a critical mechanism for enhancing our service offerings across diverse business landscapes.</p>
