        Vertical Expansion Planning | SUI 
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        
      <p>
				Justworks' mission is to help entrepreneurs and businesses grow with confidence. Until today, our PEO product has primarily enabled us to serve white-collar desk workers. But Justworksâ€™ long-term success is predicated on fulfilling our mission for <em>all small businesses</em> regardless of their industry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<p>
				This memo details our focus and the investments required for the next 12-18 months to enable a best-in-class State Unemployment Program that disrupts the industry and advances Justworks into a future where we support a diverse range of businesses leveraging a key strategic program: Vertical Expansion.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<p>
				These investments are key as they set the stage for our growth over the next year and a half, allowing us to uphold our mission and vision across all product lines.&#xa0; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><em>&#xa0;</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Our projections indicate that with these enhancements, Justworks can not only support <strong>additional small businesses </strong>within our State unemployment Insurance (SUI) program but also experience incremental, rather than linear, growth in SUI revenue. In FY25, we expect these changes to contribute <strong>$44.2 million in</strong> <strong>revenue</strong> to Justworks.

			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				<a id="yd4bfhrp12qq"></a>To elevate our SUI program into a comprehensive industry-leading platform and&#xa0; make it a major driver of growth, we are focused on the following areas - 
			</p>
			<p>
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Strategic Underwriting:</strong> Boosting our SUI underwriting capabilities with technology to serve a diverse portfolio of businesses.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Optimize PEO SUI Opportunity:</strong> Leveraging our PEO entities to create competitive SUI rates over time and improve our profit margins.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Expand Client SUI: </strong>Scaling up our SUI program to include all services for all customers in every state, not just PEO reporting states.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Seamless SUI experience: </strong>Developing comprehensive systems and streamlined processes that support our multi-product strategy, transforming the experience for both our customers and our internal teams.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Launch SUI as a Standalone platform</strong>: Setting up the SUI service as its own platform, starting with the basics of rate management, registration and claims management, so we can increase economies of scale through technology.<br />&#xa0;
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Strategic Account Maintenance: </strong>Enhancing our efforts with focused account maintenance to ensure we meet compliance standards and maintain the integrity of our SUI program.<br /><br />
          </li>
