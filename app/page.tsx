        Vertical Expansion Planning | SUI 
      </h1>

				Justworks’ mission is to help entrepreneurs and businesses grow with confidence. Until today, our PEO product has primarily enabled us to serve white-collar desk workers. But Justworks’ long-term success is predicated on fulfilling our mission for <em>all small businesses</em> regardless of their industry.

				This memo details our focus and the investments required for the next 12-18 months to enable a best-in-class State Unemployment Program that disrupts the industry and advances Justworks into a future where we support a diverse range of businesses leveraging a key strategic program: Vertical Expansion.
			</p>
			<p class="normal0">
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<p class="normal0">
				These investments are key as they set the stage for our growth over the next year and a half, allowing us to uphold our mission and vision across all product lines.&#xa0;

				<strong><em>&#xa0;</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p class="normal0">
				Our projections indicate that with these enhancements, Justworks can not only support <strong>additional small businesses </strong>within our State unemployment Insurance (SUI) program but also experience incremental, rather than linear, growth in SUI revenue. In FY25, we expect these changes to contribute <strong>$44.2 million in</strong> <strong>revenue</strong> to Justworks.
